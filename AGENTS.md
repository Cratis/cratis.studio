## Local AI work artifacts — `.ai-work/` only

AI-assisted sessions produce working artifacts: plans, handover documents, session notes, continuation prompts, status boards, scratch analyses, research dumps. These are **work records, not documentation**:

- Create every such artifact inside **`.ai-work/`** at the repository root — never at the repository root itself, never under documentation folders, never anywhere else.
- `.ai-work/` is gitignored and must stay untracked. Never commit anything inside it, never `git add -f` anything inside it, and never remove the ignore entry.
- These artifacts must never enter git history or reach GitHub — not on any branch. If you find one tracked in git, move it into `.ai-work/` and remove it from tracking in a dedicated commit.
- Knowledge that must outlive the session belongs in the repository's documentation structure through normal review, not in a work record.
